# Comparing Sports Primes

A data analysis project comparing the "prime" performance years of athletes across the four major American sports: Football (NFL), Baseball (MLB), Basketball (NBA), and Hockey (NHL).

## Overview

This project analyzes when athletes reach their peak performance across different sports and metrics. Using historical data from 2000-2015, we examine patterns in player performance relative to age to identify optimal performance windows for each sport.

## Analysis Scope

- **MLB**: Hits per at-bat vs age analysis
- **NFL**: Planned analysis of key performance metrics
- **NBA**: Planned analysis of key performance metrics  
- **NHL**: Planned analysis of key performance metrics
