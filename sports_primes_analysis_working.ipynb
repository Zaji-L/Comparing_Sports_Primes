The average player in all major sports has a significantly shorter career than the average starting lineup player."

Next we'll:\n- Compare with NFL, NBA, and NHL career trajectories\n- Analyze different performance metrics (HR, RBI, etc.)\n- Investigate factors influencing prime duration\n- Cross-sport comparison of prime performance timing"
